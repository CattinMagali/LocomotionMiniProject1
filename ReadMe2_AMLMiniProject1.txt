Exercise 2.B
    --> Should we give any explaination? Or is the plot enough?



 
Exercise 3.A.1
    --> why should we do the average value?
    
Exercise 3.A.2
    --> Anatomical frame: is [0, -1, 0] right? NO
    Accelerometer: measures in free fall, static: measures reaction from the ground
    => not -1 BUT +1 for g!!!!!!
    
Exercise 3.A.3
    --> How is computed the rotation matrix? I saw the function at the end but how was it thought or what does it mean?
    --> How to choose which vector is A and which one is B?
    
Exercise 3.A.4 
    --> How to apply the rotation matrix? Why should we transpose?
    --> What do we expect as a result? Put the y signal on the zero?
    
Exercise 3.A.5
    --> Should we calculate 3 different matrix of rotation that we can apply to the different columns of the data.accelstat?
    
Exercise 3.B.1
    --> Way of thinking: is it correct?
    
Exercise 3.B.2
    --> How is computed the rotation matrix? 1st column = x, 2nd = y, 3rd = z?
    --> Should I take the inverse? Because it means: from TF to GF?
    
Exercise 3.B.3
    --> Procedure to find AF_x,y,z, is it correct?
    
Exercise 3.C.1 & 2
    loop on each time frame BUT
    --> keep the 3 dimensions?
    --> how to normalize?
    
Exercise 3.C.3
    1. Define anatomical axis of the foot
    2. Estimate the angle alpha <--- formula
    --> How to define the anatomical axis of the foot? (which corresponds to u)
    --> How to define n?
